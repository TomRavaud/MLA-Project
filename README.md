# 'Advanced Machine Learning' Project
*In French: Machine Learning Avanc√© (MLA)*

The goal of this project is to reproduce the results of a recent research paper in the field of Deep Learning (DL). Our group has chosen the paper [**"Net2Net: Accelerating Learning via Knowledge Transfer"**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05641) by Chen et al. (2016) which introduces **Net2Net** techniques, aiming at transferring quickly the knowledge from a previously trained network to a wider or deeper one.
