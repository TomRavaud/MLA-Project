# Inception-V2 on ImageNet

**The code developed in this folder is no longer maintained. Please refer to the `inceptionv2_cifar` folder for the latest version of the training code for the Inception-V2 architecture.**

This folder contains the code for the experiments we conducted to apply the Net2Net techniques to the Inception-V2 architecture on the ImageNet dataset.

It is organized as follows:
- `main.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook that can be used to train the Inception-V2 model on the MNIST dataset.
- `demo_net2wider.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook that can be used to visualize the principle of the Net2WiderNet technique.
- `logs/` is a folder used to store the logs of the experiments.
