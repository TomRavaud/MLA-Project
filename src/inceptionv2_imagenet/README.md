# Inception V2 on ImageNet

This folder contains the code for the Net2Net techniques, as well as the code for the experiments we conducted to apply them to the Inception V2 architecture on the ImageNet dataset.

It is organized as follows:
- `main.py` contains the code to run the experiments.
- `inceptionv2.py` contains the implementation of the inception v2 model.
