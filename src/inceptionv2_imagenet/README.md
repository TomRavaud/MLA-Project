# Inception-V2 on ImageNet

This folder contains the code for the experiments we conducted to apply the Net2Net techniques to the Inception-V2 architecture on the ImageNet dataset.

It is organized as follows:
- `main.py` contains the code to run the experiments.
- `inceptionv2.py` contains the implementation of the Inception-V2 model.
