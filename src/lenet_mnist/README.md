# LeNet on MNIST

**The code developed in this folder is no longer maintained. Please refer to the `inceptionv2_cifar` folder for the latest version of the training code for the Inception-V2 architecture.**

This folder contains the code for the Net2Net techniques, as well as the code for the experiments we conducted to apply them to the LeNet architecture on the MNIST dataset.

It is organized as follows:
- `main.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook that can be used to train the LeNet model on the MNIST dataset.
- `demo_net2wider.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook that can be used to visualize the principle of the Net2WiderNet technique.
- `demo_net2deeper.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook that can be used to visualize the principle of the Net2DeeperNet technique.
- `logs/` is a folder used to store the logs of the experiments.
