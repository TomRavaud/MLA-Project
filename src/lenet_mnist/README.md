# LeNet on MNIST

This folder contains the code for the Net2Net techniques, as well as the code for the experiments we conducted to apply them to the LeNet architecture on the MNIST dataset.

It is organized as follows:
- `main.py` contains the code to run the experiments.
- `lenet.py` contains the implementation of the LeNet model.
